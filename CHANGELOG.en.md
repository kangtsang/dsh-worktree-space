# Changelog

What changed in each release. Earlier versions live in the git history only; the per-release
evidence for host compatibility is in [`docs/store-evidence.md`](docs/store-evidence.md).
The Chinese version is [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## 1.3.1 — 2026-10-18

Fixes on the Docker deploy-for-acceptance and conflict hand-off paths, plus two documentation
gaps closed.

### Fixed

- **The deploy and smoke buttons no longer report a missing script on Windows.** The `bash` on
  Windows is not a shell and cannot read a native path such as `D:\...`, so an entry that was
  plainly on disk was reported as `No such file or directory`. The plugin now picks a real shell
  itself, and says so plainly when it finds none.
- **The deploy entry cannot find its own tools.** The fix above let the script run for the first
  time, which exposed `dirname: command not found` on the very next line — a shell started by
  absolute path does not get the utilities beside it. The plugin hands those over now.
- **The smoke and destroy buttons disappear.** Containers came up under the deploy entry's own
  default environment id, so the plugin looked for this task's id, found nothing and treated the
  environment as having no containers at all. The `up` and `smoke` commands in a task space's note
  now carry that id.
- **Handing a conflict to an agent adds a Workspace nobody asked for.** The hand-off session was
  opened on the container root, leaving a row in the workspace list named after a directory that
  holds every project's task spaces. It is opened in the task space itself now, and the finish
  that removes the task space drops that row with it.
- **The conflict session does not appear under its task space.** A session opened on a directory
  that is already a Workspace does not join it by itself, so it worked in the right directory and
  still sat in Ungrouped. The plugin now files it there explicitly.

### Documentation

- Deploying for acceptance now states its prerequisite: a container engine this machine can reach
  (`docker` on PATH with its daemon running). Docker Desktop, Podman, colima and a native Linux
  engine all count.

### Compatibility

- The window covers six DSH releases, adding `0.2.1-rc.1` and `0.2.1-rc.2`.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-10-16

Everything that changed since 1.2.1. This is what a user or an agent can observe; how it was
arrived at is not here.
